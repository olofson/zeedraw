20140105:
	* Moved test suite utility code into zdtutils.[ch].
	* Added balls.c test program.
	* Moved to GitHub.

20130325:
	* zd_Fill() no longer allowed under root. (Pointless special cases...)

20130323:
	* The basic transform inlines no longer deal with entities; only raw
	  matrices and offsets.

20130322:
	* zd_Layer() and zd_Window() initialize bg color to opaque black.
	* Added glClearStencil(), glStencilOp(), glStencilFunc() and
	  glColorMask() to GLI.
	* Implemented OpenGL stencil clipping for rotated windows.

20130321:
	* Scale 0.0 should be safe.
	* Removed the initial transform arguments from entity creation calls.
	* Added enumerated parameter API.
	* zd_Fill() can now safely be a child of the root entity.
	* Added -G and -S switches to zdtest.
	* Less random scene content in zdtest.

20130320:
	* Added zd_CalculateMatrix(), zd_InvTransformPointM() etc.
	* zd_Fill() texture transform now works correctly.

20130319:
	* zdtest uses the state where appropriate, to get the actual error
	  codes when aborting due to failures.

20130318:
	* Added zd_Fill() entity.
	* Added zd_SetTexture().

20130317:
	* Added zd_Primitive() and ZD_primitives.
	* Moved texture DecRef from backends into zeedraw.c.

20130316:
	* All entity creation calls now have a 'flags' argument.
	* Added zd_Vertex*D(), zd_Vertices(), zd_TexCoord() and zd_TexCoords().

20130315:
	* Added frame rate calculation and -s switch to zdtest.
	* Added zdogl_apply_matrix() for using OpenGL transforms. However, the
	  custom transforms are 34% faster here, so, disabled by default!

20130314:
	* Window clipping and background coordinates are transformed properly.
	* Sprite Render() uses zd_TransformPoint() - no legacy OpenGL calls.

20130313:
	* ZD_RETHINK now actually applied recursively, as intended.
	* Added zd_TransformPoint().
	* Implemented axis-aligned clipping for windows via glScissor().

20130312:
	* OpenGL backend PreRender()/PostRender() just sets the matrices to
	  identity, and layers and windows deal only with the MODELVIEW matrix.
	* Layers now handle translucent background colors properly.
	* Added ZD_SETORIGO flag for zd_Window() to set origo of the window to
	  (x, y), instead of the default; keeping that of the parent entity.
	* Added initialization of optional callback fields in zd_NewEntity().
	* Sanity check for layers; they can only ever be children of root!
	* Added glScissor() to GLI.
	* Implemented zd_Window(). (Clipping unfinished!)

20130311:
	* Added RenderPost() (post children) entity backend callback.
	* Added zd_Layer().
	* Added zd_View() for changing the extents of entities that support it.
	* Added ZD_CLEAR entity flag for layers and windows.
	* Added 'kind' entity type field, and 'kind' arguments to
	  zd_AllocEntity() and zd_NewEntity().
	* Added zd_Color().
	* Removed "Set" from zd_SetPosition(), zd_SetScale() etc.
	* Removed the zd_*Transform() calls.
	* Removed ZD_window.x and .y. (The real entity position is supposed to
	  be the "live" position of the window! We only add w and h.)
	* Proper antialiasing of the generated sprite in zdtest.
	* Added fade-in effect to zdtest.
	* Added zd_BGColor() for layers and windows.
	* Added glColor4f() to GLI.

20130310:
	* Added flags argument to zd_Open(). (No flags yet!)
	* Added reference counting to entities.
	* Added zd_Retain*()/zd_Release*() calls.
	* Added context argument to zd_Open(), for passing the display
	  SDL_surface or similar object (driver dependent) representing the
	  rendering context.

20130309:
	* Added ZD_entity.t* transformed parameters for rendering.
	* Implemented nested entity transforms with rotation/scaling matrix.

20130308:
	* Implemented OpenGL texture uploading.
	* Improved the zdtest sprite texture generator.
	* Added ZD_VISIBLE flag.
	* Added relative transform manipulation; zd_Move(), zd_Rotate() etc.
	* Added zd_First() and zd_Next().
	* Added animation; zd_CMove(), zd_CRotate() etc.

20130307:
	* Entity graphs are now recursively destroyed as intended.
	* Added zd_ReleaseTexture().
	* Added OpenGL context and state initialization code.

20130306:
	* Pixel endian defined as memory byte order, similar to OpenGL.
	* Started porting OpenGL code from the EEL OpenGL binding.
	* Added state.texturesize and zd_Bump*Size() inlines.
	* Added entity z coordinate and zd_Position3D().

20130305:
	* ZD_RGB is now 32 bpp with padding - not 24 bpp.
	* Added backend method UploadTexture().
	* Added texture method stubs to the backends.

20130304:
	* Added zd_OnDemandTexture().
	* Added zd_TextureFromData().

20130303:
	* Texture locking.
	* Implemented zd_LockTextureRegion().

20130226:
	* Texture creation and texture render callbacks.

20130113:
	* Ported the OpenGL loader/interface from EELBox.
	* Beginnings of the OpenGL backend.

20130105...:
	* Design and framework implementation.

20130103:
	* Started new CMake project.
